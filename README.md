## "Welcome to the 'Line-Liberator': Unleashing the Magic of get_next_line in C! üìú‚ú®"


Description:

This repository contains a C implementation of the get_next_line function, designed to read lines from a file descriptor one at a time. The function returns the line that was read or NULL if there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred.



## üõ† Usage



Repeated calls to 'get_next_line' allow sequential reading of a text file, providing one line at a time. It works seamlessly both with files and standard input.


## Compilation

To compile the code, use the following command:

```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=n <files>.c
```
    
Replace n with the desired buffer size. For example, to compile with a buffer size of 42:

```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
```
(You could also use the gcc compiler instead of the cc compiler)
## üìù Notes



. The buffer size can be adjusted by defining BUFFER_SIZE at compilation time.

. It's important to handle cases where the file descriptor changes between calls to get_next_line.

. While reading binary files is considered to have undefined behavior, logical handling can be implemented if desired.
